CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for the Java EE platform is one of several Java EE 6 features that help to knit together the web tier and the transactional tier of the Java EE platform.

Producers may be used to create - or produce - bean instances to be consumed by an application. Producers are also able to provide specific interface implementations according to the consumer needs so they are a valid way to support polymorphism in a CDI application.

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven addresses two aspects of building software: first, it describes how software is built, and second, it describes its dependencies.
